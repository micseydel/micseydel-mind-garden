I recently looked into "*the* scientific method" and found far more uncertainty than I expected ðŸ˜† Such is science ðŸ¤·

How are intentions and hypotheses related?
* Experiment template? Costs? Worst/average case cost? Catastophication?
* How has science changed over time? Systemically? How has it adapted, are there maldaptations? Compare to the evolution of my mind graph
* Testable hypotheses is like pruning futures, or figuring out what timeline you're in
* Framing a *hope* as a hypothesis
	* Helps to be more open-minded
	* Helps to remember that life is iterative, not one-off
	* The *correct* hypothesis might even turn out to be better since it matches reality better
