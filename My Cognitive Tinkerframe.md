# What's wrong with regular PKM?

## First - what's not wrong?

[[Personal knowledge management systems (PKMS)]] are great and I think people should be building them more. I feel like they make things possible (sometimes by simply lowering the cost) that otherwise would never happen. Much like math would be largely limited to arithmetic without paper, I feel like my cognition without a PKMS would be limited by more than an order of magnitude if I can't think [[The Extended Mind (book)|outside my mind]].

## Personal Cognitive Limits

That said, though I am working on [[Healing and Therapy|healing]] I have severe trauma and a diagnosis of complex PTSD. Productivity-focused culture often feels quite toxic to me and even with Obsidian and transcribed voice memos available to me, there are two particular topics of thought that can be triggering. It is not to say that I can't think those thoughts, but the cost can be prohibitive most of the time. I don't have excess cognitive wealth at this moment, so those thoughts happen in bursts and spurts, infrequently and unpredictably. Not fast enough for my liking.

I'll focus on one of the two topics above - my cats. [[Peanut ðŸ¥œ|One of them]] has [Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC)](https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/feline-idiopathic-cystitis) and due to my personal trauma, caregiving for a kitty who could literally be killed by anxiety and a few days of neglect is extraordinarily stressful. I also don't have a second pair of hands local who might be able to help, so I find myself needing to figure out how to manage my stress in order to be independent.

As a positive, I am able to write up notes (or code) *around* the triggering issues and approach things more obliquely. I am tempted to oversimplify things to reduce my todolist, but realistically anxiety is a system-level issue, so I need to identify the components and how they are connected. Though it would be easier to consider my sick kitty in isolation, he isn't isolated - his routine is connected to my own and he has a relationship with his sister that can't be ignored. It's complicated!

# Externalized Cognition

Much like scientists have systems to extend their cognition, I want to do the same. They follow procedures that help to mitigate and document any potential bias, then seek peer review to help with whatever their own extended mind (brain plus lab plus whatever) might have missed. *Before* peer review there might be math or other procedures as a quality check first - you wouldn't publish to a physics journal if none of the math adds up. When used correctly, math can alert us to self-trickery without requiring other minds.

Just like a scientist cannot measure speed directly, but can determine it by measuring locations at different times, I can work around my cognitive limits. This includes something like determining speed, which people can often do intuitively enough to not bother with calculations (or even tools that do it for us). In this analogy, I am someone who cannot intuitively see speeds but am perfectly capable of using the information if I can get it into my head.

This is all to say, I can take voice memos and write code that turns those voice memos into reports. The machinations of organizing that stuff by hand used to be something I did, but my mental health worsened and I had to stop. I can look at specific voice memos and as long as I don't try to contextualize/link them with my biobrain then my cognitive disability doesn't surface.

(expand on idea of blindspot mirrors - not fancy sonar/radar, have to be checked, but cheap and effective)

# Replacing thinking with code

If you imagine my brain like the graph in Obsidian (e.g. top right at the time of this writing), there are notes/nodes that cannot be linked, you just get an error message... or worse, it silently doesn't work ðŸ˜± or all the tabs connected to the ones you just tried to connect get closed and you can't remember what they were. I can scaffold my broken mind with code that replaces mechanistic thinking such as organizing voice memos into reports. Nodes in my brain will connect out to my tinkerframe which will connect back in - a kind of bypass. If it's worth the opportunity cost, I may experiment with internalizing that connection since healing properly would be the ideal outcome.

It might be a cognitive slog, but I can work my way through those reports. I can review hypotheses that I formed, data points that are linked, and I can mark hypotheses as falsified and generate new ones. Most specifically, I have notes on which wet food the cats like as well as notes on litter use. The [Litter Robot](https://www.litter-robot.com/litter-robot-iii-open-air-with-connect.html) I use allows a spreadsheet export of events (e.g. cat detected, cycle ran, cycle interrupted, etc.) and I always take a picture during the litter cycle that ends up in Google Photos so if I can double-check my perception if inconsistencies in the data suggest a cognitive slump.

## But not *just* code

By "encoding" my intentions/desires in a programming language I am being mindful and deliberate about what I want. That is honestly part of this process - describing the desired system fully in excruciating detail. Computer code and digital tools are *not* the only way to do this though!

I've been thinking about writing hypotheses on my whiteboard and a flowchart for what to do when my cat seems anxious. The hypotheses I think should live in [[My Mind Graph]], but doing the flow chart digitally would require me learning a new tool I don't already know. I can *really easily* make updates on the whiteboard, and I can always take pictures and put them in my mind graph. Sticky notes are just as valid.

The [[Perfectionism|perfectionist]] in me doesn't like [[Compromise|compromising]] and would rather my phone contain a digital solution to every problem, work offline, but also have a perfect sync mechanism (that lets me configure if/when cellular data is used), etc.. The rational part of me has run the perfectionist experiment and falsified the idea that it's effective at what it purports to do. Whiteboard and laptop with an external monitor are best, a tiny screen will not compete for the foreseeable future.

# Bottom-up science

I'm working on [[Healing and Therapy]] and ideally that would allow me to write the reports manually again. By if I already automated it, why would I ever do it manually again? In fact, the code I wrote performs a similar function to peer review in that a limitation within my biobrain was worked around. Much like Tiago Forte pivoted his "second brain" I wish to make lemonade with my cognitive lemon.

## Simple example - headaches

I have not looked for science to figure out if naproxen is better than ibuprofen for headaches. Or if aspirin is better, or fish oil would do it. Reading someone else's research about other people wouldn't necessarily apply to me anyway, would it? Science is rarely 100% even when done *perfectly* (which is almost never due to expense if no other reason).

I have in the past kept track of my medication use in a spreadsheet. I thought that would help me learn about what helps with headaches, but realistically... no. Even for a data nerd like me, it's an unrealistic amount of time and energy and I barely know what I'm doing anyway. There's also missing context, unless you have a very noise spreadsheet.

With [[My Mind Graph]] ðŸ§ ðŸ•¸ I now have context. I no longer use spreadsheets for my personal PKM, I put that information into my Mind Graph in a (mostly) consistent format. Data points (headaches) can be linked to specific hypotheses. But it's still a lot of work. Mechanistic work...

![[Tinkerframe - initial projects#Headache interventions]]

## General

I have given somewhat concrete examples, but this system can be repurposed for anything. I was/am too lazy to constantly set a timer for 2 hours after taking something for a headache, let alone vary that time delay. Especially if I *have a headache*! But I'm not too lazy to use a system like this, particularly if I start the habit out of necessity.

# Quick point on naming ðŸ§ ðŸ› ðŸ•¸

For the moment I am saying "*Cognitive* Tinkerframe" even though it might seem more *digital* than cognitive. This is intentional, because digital tech is wonderful and all but sometimes what you really need are sticky notes or a whiteboard. Self-talk is an important part of this system as well as my habits. The center is cognition, not shiny digital tools/apps, which are *part of* the *frame* and are only kept as long as they help with the tinkering rather than hinder it. But my cats and I are *in the frame*.

# Current tooling choices

* [[My Mind Graph]] ðŸ§ ðŸ•¸ - plaintext wiki-links Markdown and Git as the core
    * [[public_mind_garden/Obsidian|Obsidian]] as the *lens* for it
        * Caveat regarding Markdown - I have made and plan to make compromises on the readability of the Markdown to make Obsidian a nicer lens, with a note tracking it so that it doesn't get out of hand (which would lock me into Obsidian)
        * Alternatives considered
            * Roam (tried)
            * Logseq
            * Tiddlywiki
            * Vimwiki (will investigate for an "emergency eject")
* Coding
    * Python
    * Need to revisit Scala
    * Typescript
        * ViolentMonkey
            * Discord is the first use-case for me - I find it to be a sensory nightmare but know I can work around that
        * Obsidian plugins
        * Firefox extensions - look at [RES](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-enhancement-suite/kbmfpngjjgdllneeigpgjifpgocmfgmb?hl=en-US) as a reference
* Voice memos (primary mobile capture)
    * Pixel - lacks bulk exports
    * Otter - bulk exports aren't great
    * Google Keep - ==currently experimenting==

## Role of AI today

Right now I don't use AI much or at all in my system. A broad definition would include Google Photos since it includes some classification (e.g. "there's a cat in this picture"). I also use TabNine for coding, but unlike Github Copilot it works offline. That said, I wish to limit AI integration for the moment and introduce it mindfully. OpenAI Whisper sure looks interesting though, and I am confident [human-AI fusion is the way of the future](https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/commentanalysis/arid-30975938.html).

The BASBc15 Circle group had a discussion about this that I would love to dive back into.

## Future tools

I would love to have something like Google Glass, but better. As a compromise, a single LED (mono/tri/multi-color) that flashes in pre-programmed ways at the corner of my vision could be an amazing compromise. Or maybe something more... [discreet](https://github.com/RonSijm/ButtFish) ðŸ¤·â™Ÿ

# Precedent

I think it's fair to say that social media such as Facebook can act as a cognitive tinkerframe. The biggest differences are (1) what is being optimized for and (2) who is aware of what. The Algorithm isn't necessarily operating on people with regard to things they can be conscious of, it may go straight to our ego and bypass being easy to understand.
