# Intro

I want to [learn in public](https://github.com/readme/guides/publishing-your-work). This is also practice for a wiki about my cats for my vet.

Like a garden, this is an "organic" space in the sense that if you leave and return, new things may have blossomed, some will have been pruned, and some will have matured. All links here should be considered temporary, though I hope at some point to provide better support for bookmarks.

I also consider this a way for me to build a reputation, in the sense that I can establish a public pattern of trying to be consistent and elaborating on apparent inconsistencies. It's a way to hold myself accountable and empower those who want to hold me accountable to do so as well. I'll get this on Github with history at some point, with the commits signed with a [private key](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/private-key-cryptography).

Besides accountability, peer review is lovely! [[COVID Hermiting]] is my first example, I welcome respectful challenges where we might have different values but can still have discussions. You can also checkout [[About Me (Michael Seydel)|About Me]].

# How is it different from a blog?

I do not currently have a blog, but if I did, posts would 
* be fairly linear
* have a date
* note edits with dates
* get put through [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/)
* be peer-reviewed privately before public posts

That's all a lot more work ðŸ˜†

That said, a blog can fulfill similar functions to this garden. Public things like this can also act like a "second brain" even if you're not keeping a lot of private notes.

# Advantage over a blog

The non-linear nature of this garden means that instead of pruning down to an acceptable word count for a blog and carefully considering how much detail to include, I just try to have reasonable sized and organized notes and any reader can go into the level of detail they want.

I feel like often when I'm talking about my life, it's like showing someone a tapestry with a magnifying glass. Some parts will look different enough than others that they don't make sense without context. This at least lets you take that magnifying glass and move it around ðŸ˜†

# Future work

Ideally I'd like to put some of these pages through Grammarly as well as break them up to mostly not be more than a regular (computer) screen size or two.
