# The gist

I am currently living alone for the first time in my life. In February 2021 I quit my job and in April 2021 I left my living situation due to it becoming unsafe. In the aftermath of April 2021 my entire support network crumbled.

In November 2021 I got cats. Beginning in February 2022 one of them revealed having a chronic condition. Per my [[Current Goals]], everything else I'm doing takes a backseat to taking care of them. When my cats are doing ok, I focus on [[Current Goals#‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Healing|healing]] and processing complex trauma.

Last year was quite a mess but this year (2022 at the time of this writing) has been spent [putting myself back together](https://youtu.be/Vgcg7K0KoBw?t=129). In April 2022 I learned about [[Networked Thinking]] which revolutionized my ability to get and stay organized.

# Day to day

At the time of this writing, I am doing regular talk therapy as well as seeing adjunct practitioners for [EMDR](https://www.emdr.com/what-is-emdr/) and [Hakomi](https://hakomiinstitute.com/). Between these activities and the note-making I do around them, this is a substantial portion of where my time goes. I'm trying to do [[The Work]] and not just show up to the sessions.

## Activities

Besides explicit healing activities, I am doing things that might look lazy from the outside. I play video games sometimes, and I've found that inducing flow can help get thoughts on separate topics unstuck. I basically bounce back and forth between the game and my notes. Multi-tasking isn't particularly efficient, but I find that this allows me to have thoughts I can't have intentionally (much like the [Wu-Wei Paradox](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-athletes-way/202201/the-wu-wei-paradox-striving-less-generates-more-success)).

I also watch a lot of TV right now. I'm often watching shows from earlier in my life (e.g. [[About Me (Michael Seydel)#Select Favorites|Fringe]]) and it's interesting to feel how my perspective has changed. TV shows give me different lenses with which to view the world, and re-watching shows helps with anxiety.

I also spend a decent chunk of time on Reddit. This might sound silly, but the CPTSD sub has been incredibly useful and I plan to (eventually) write in depth about my experience with Reddit. Reddit also gives me new lenses, though I obviously have to be careful with that.

When things with my cats and healing go well enough, I focus on [[My Cognitive Tinkerframe]].
