Personal knowledge management (PKM) is the practice of taking notes that are useful in a lifelong fashion. [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) is probably the largest community doing it right now so if you see "BASB" or "second brain" that's PKM. There's also [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/) (LYT or "light") though I haven't looked into it much yet. When S is at the end, it's about the *system* rather than the *practice*.

Prior to learning about BASB I referred to my "second brain" as my "mind graph" though I'm still figuring out my preferred terminology. Much like [[How I got into coding]], my [[My PKMS journey]] started with personal experimentation rather than any formal learning.

I think the "personal" part of PKM is particularly important. As a software engineer, I've done substantial KM using wiki software like Confluence, but "personal" KM means that you can develop intimate ==rapport== with your system instead of worrying about how others might engage with it. If you took two brilliant people and gave them the same information to organize into a PKMS, there would clearly be overlap but the systems would be wildly different and not interchangeable.
