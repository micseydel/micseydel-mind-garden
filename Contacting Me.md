I prefer email ([for now](https://cfenollosa.com/blog/after-self-hosting-my-email-for-twenty-three-years-i-have-thrown-in-the-towel-the-oligopoly-has-won.html)): micseydel@gmail.com

I also like Signal for realtime but have not really used it. I am mostly only doing asynchronous communication unless it's someone I've felt comfortable with for years.
