# Cognitive bypass

If you imagine my brain like the graph in [[Obsidian]] (e.g. top right of this garden at the time of this writing), there are notes/nodes that cannot be linked, you just get an error message... or worse, it silently doesn't work ðŸ˜± or all the tabs connected to the ones you just tried to connect get closed and you can't remember what they were.

I can scaffold my broken mind with code that replaces mechanistic thinking such as organizing voice memos into reports. Nodes in my brain will connect out to my tinkerframe which will connect back in - a kind of bypass. If it's worth the opportunity cost, I may experiment with internalizing that connection since healing properly would be the ideal outcome.

# Intentionality

One of the benefits of writing code for my system is that I have to be deliberate and my intentions become visible - I could have someone else review the code! The idea of *encoding* my intentions unambiguously I think is beneficial even if I don't run the code.
