# Intended milestones

## Continuing with beta

Hopefully I can finish these things this year. I'd mostly like to handle [[#Accessible images (and process)|simple accessibility]] and see it with [[#Posts to include|basic posts]] before using [[#GPG-signed commits]].

### Accessible images (and process)

For example, I tried a plugin for managing binaries and images and it didn't work. Should I revisit that?

### GPG-signed commits

Mention why SSH didn't work - required too new of tools

## Posts to include

* COVID hermiting ([e.g.](https://www.news-medical.net/amp/news/20221127/Long-COVID-brain-fog-and-fatigue-negatively-impact-all-facets-of-daily-life.aspx))
* Thoughts on spirituality
* Maybe
	* My system for [[Current Goals#üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Therapy]] notes
	* Chesteron's Fence (and Elon Musk)

## Version 1.0

I intend for this to have a changelog, separate from Git commits.
