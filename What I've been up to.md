# Lead-up

Since lockdown started, I've been a [[COVID Hermiting|COVID hermit]]. I have a personal zero-COVID policy so I have mostly not breathed the same air as others for quite a long time.

Quick timeline
* February 2021 I quit my job - it was the right time, following an acquisition
* April 2021
    * I was rear-ended on the freeway and my car nearly totaled
    * Roommate drama, I was advised by my therapist (who *knew* the roommate) to move out for my own safety
* June
    * I got my own place, having never lived alone before
    * Around this time, I started dating someone, lost another friend, and then broke up with and lost the friend I had started dating ðŸ™ƒ
* Various drama through November
    * Then I got cats! See: [[Peanut ðŸ¥œ]]
    * Things were chill until February 2022
    * I started [putting myself back together](https://youtu.be/Vgcg7K0KoBw?t=129)
* February 2022 - Peanut started having a medical issue
* April - learned about [[0_mind_garden/private_mind_garden/buffer/pkm/Networked Thinking]]
* Worked on my notes, organizing thoughts on everything that happened, [[Healing and Therapy]]
* August/September - Peanut started getting better

# Now

## Internal - The Work

I have been doing talk therapy for [[Healing and Therapy|some time]], and recently added [EMDR](https://www.emdr.com/what-is-emdr/) and [Hakomi](https://hakomiinstitute.com/) as adjuncts after finding that a somatic approach is an essential ingredient for my own healing. I feel like I'm a lock that needs to be picked, and each pin is a different modality. Things "bind" briefly at times but I do end up backtracking.

## External work

For the last few years in an [[Personal knowledge management systems (PKMS)|accelerating manner]], I was keeping personal notes in Google Docs until March 2022. In April, I discovered Roam Research and [Networked Thinking](https://www.appsntips.com/what-is-networked-thinking/) originally via [this post about mind gardening](https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/mind-gardening-organise-thoughts-increase-productivity). This allowed a massive increase in my ability to organize things.

I have since switched from Roam to Obsidian, and am additionally working on [[My Cognitive Tinkerframe]] which includes writing Python code to handle voice memos about my cats.

## Day to day

As of early October 2022, Peanut is my highest priority. The quick timeline above skips over a lot, I spent at least half that time acutely dealing with various crises. Since April 2021 I have not felt like I had a break more than a week or so and I've never started "[catching up](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/xx5t0u/70_of_my_energy_is_spent_trying_to_survive_30_is/)". Peanut recently was doing good for about a month and I have a plan but it's stressful ðŸ˜•

So I work on my notes, take voice memos, read [[About Me (Michael Seydel)#Books|books]] and listen to podcasts on walks. I play video games and take breaks to make notes. I'm generally trying to balance [[Current Goals]] with simply resting and slowing down. The books and other media give me lenses I wouldn't have come up with on my own. Video games allow flow state so that my unconscious mind can process things. I also use THC regularly to give myself new perspectives and look forward to examining that more with [[My Cognitive Tinkerframe]].

# Future

I want to continue working on my tinkerframe, [[Healing and Therapy]], and start socializing in whatever capacity [[COVID Hermiting|makes sense at the time]]. While the near-term will be spent primarily on own needs, I'd like to write about my healing in case others might benefit from it and to share code I write for my tinkerframe, but sharing is a secondary priority for me right now.
