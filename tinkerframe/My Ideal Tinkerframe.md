# Solved problems

- Keeping track of experiments - hypotheses, observations, etc
- Tracking expiration of items (food, medicine, etc)
- Preventing taking too much medication
    - Like me with acetaminophen
- Voice memos for anything related to my cats

# Aspirational

- Notify me when beliefs I hold appear to be inconsistent
- Notify me when a changed belief means a domino effect that I should look into

# To organize

- *Reframing*
- Skill graph (not a tree)
- Performs encoding for me

## Misc tooling

- Screenshots automatically go to vault instead of desktop (on OS X at least)
- Automatically put Fitbit data into daily notes, or something that the daily notes template links to
