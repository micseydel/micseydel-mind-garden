# Background

Here are some basic science things
* Observations
* Experiments
* Hypothesis / predictions
* Peer-review
* Replication
* [[Encoding|Pre-registration]]

I recently looked into "*the* scientific method" and found far more uncertainty than I expected ðŸ˜† Such is science ðŸ¤· The above are all generally included in modern science though. You might wonder why double-blind placebo-controlled trials aren't up there...

People think of science as being something that *a scientist* does in a lab, that the scientist had to go to college for. That's what I might call "top-down science" where it's more centralized, including academic journals being involved. But there's also "citizen science" and what I'd call "bottom-up science" where individuals doing science could aggregate their findings without centralizing on any authority (e.g. journals or universities).

# Me

[[My Cognitive Tinkerframe]] is honestly my best attempt at a personal scientific method that works best for me. It focuses on *testable hypotheses* and "pruning" mental models based on observations, where those mental models are my best attempts at getting a grasp on reality.

I find that science helps me keep a curious mindset. As such, *hopes*, *fears* and similar are all *hypotheses*. I can ground myself in a locus-of-control kind of way by [[Encoding]] my fears/hopes/whatever as hypotheses and then focusing on the testable ones. This helps me to be more open-minded and to remember that life is iterative, not one-off.

# Future work on this topic

I want to look more into the history of science, particularly before it was done "at scale" (e.g. large clinical trials). I want to see what systematic adaptations have occurred in science, for example due to financial scarcity as markets go through up/down cycles. Are there any [[Calibration|maladaptations]] that have been retained from a bygone era?
