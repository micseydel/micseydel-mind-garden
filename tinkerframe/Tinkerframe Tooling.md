There's a sense in which a [[My Cognitive Tinkerframe|cognitive tinkerframe]] is "just" [[Personal knowledge management systems (PKMS)|PKMS]] with a particular focus. For that reason the tooling choices are specific to me, much like a [[Personal knowledge management systems (PKMS)#Building a Second Brain|"second brain"]] is personal to the individual.

I consider [[Obsidian]] to be the *lens* through which I view plaintext wiki-links Markdown stored in Git. That plaintext can be manipulated outside of Obsidian. Obsidian can be configured to have different UI for the notes that go into this public garden.

# Additional tools

## Coding

As of this writing, I have some Python code written, but that is largely because I am familiar enough with Python to get things done quickly. I plan to learn Typescript, but have also been meaning to re-evaluate Scala's role here. I expect to include Kotlin for Android development but that is not part of my short-term plans.

In an ideal world, I would be able to use a single language to wrote code that works offline across my laptop, phone and ideally iPad as well.

### Typescript

There are three primary use-cases for Typescript right now
1. Firefox extensions - look at [RES](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-enhancement-suite/kbmfpngjjgdllneeigpgjifpgocmfgmb?hl=en-US) as a reference
2. Obsidian plugins
3. ViolentMonkey
	* (predecessor of GreaseMonkey, kind of like saved semi-ad hoc browser extensions)

## Voice memos

There is no voice memo tool currently that I really like. Ideally I would have bulk exports of transcriptions, with time-stamps. Google Pixel Recorder lacks bulk exports. Otter.ai's bulk exports require manual scrolling and to get a timestamp you have to export as PDF ðŸ™ƒ Google Keep is nice in that I can add labels (tags) to notes on mobile, but again there's no bulk export.

I plan to pick one (or more) of these tools and build code around the deficiencies. I expect to end up preferring OpenAI Whisper over any of these tools as-is, but we'll see.

## Hardware

I currently have a [Litter Robot](https://www.litter-robot.com/litter-robot-iii-open-air-with-connect.html) which generates a spreadsheet of events. I can correlate this against my voice memos. I'd also need to buy hardware to use OpenAI Whisper.

## Future tools

I would love to have something like Google Glass, but better. A single LED (mono/tri/multi-color) that flashes in pre-programmed ways at the corner of my vision could be an amazing compromise. Or maybe something more... [discreet](https://github.com/RonSijm/ButtFish) ðŸ¤·â™Ÿ

I would also love to augment Google Photos.
