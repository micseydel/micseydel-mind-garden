# Cats

Result: report generated from voice memos and Litter Robot spreadsheet. Details such as average uses per day, average time between uses, common times of the day.

Secondary: take the above and create an wiki using Obsidian Publish for my vet or a cat consultant to review.

# Headache interventions

I had wanted to build an Android app but have decided to [[Compromise|compromise]]. Instead I'll write something in Python that uses SMS, something I did back in high school. I will message it when I have a headache and it will tell me what to try. It will then check in with me later and ask how I feel. The code will have hypotheses and use Bayes' formula to adjust confidence levels based on how I report feeling. While I could do what the code is doing myself, I don't want to ðŸ˜Š

The SMS compromise might seem like not a big deal, but I strongly prefer avoiding relying on internet if a system doesn't really need it (I'm look at *you* every single freaking IOT device). I am generally trying to reduce dependencies my system has, especially external ones. Ideally my system would be available while hiking and not be subject to instability due to infrastructure other than electricity (which I could theoretically have solar panels for).

# Future work

Once the initial system is in place, it will essentially experiment on me and at some point let me know to check out a generated report. I will then manually link that report in any useful ways, and later I can (semi-)automate linking if it's mechanistic and time-consuming enough to bother.
