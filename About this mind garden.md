# Intro

Like a garden, this is an "organic" space in the sense that if you leave and return, new things may have blossomed, some will have been pruned, and some will have matured. All links here should be considered temporary, though I hope at some point to provide better support for bookmarks.

I want to [[Learning in public|learn in public]]. I also consider this a way for me to build a reputation, in the sense that I can establish a public pattern of trying to be consistent and elaborating on apparent inconsistencies. It's a way to hold myself accountable and empower those who want to hold me accountable to do so as well. 
Besides accountability, peer review is lovely! I am currently a COVID hermit and want to write about why so others can (potentially) point out where I might be mistaken. You can also checkout [[About Me (Michael Seydel)|About Me]] or [[My Cognitive Tinkerframe]].

# How is it different from a blog?

I do not currently have a blog, but if I did, posts would 
* be fairly linear
* have a date
* note edits with dates
* get put through [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/)
* be peer-reviewed privately before public posts

That's all a lot more work ðŸ˜† It's also all friction that would be a perfectionist distraction from my true goal, which is to get my ideas out there and start publicly living my note-making lifestyle.

That said, a blog can fulfill similar functions to this garden. Public things like this can also act like a "[[Personal knowledge management systems (PKMS)#Building a Second Brain|second brain]]" even if you're not keeping a lot of private notes.

# Advantage over a blog

The non-linear nature of this garden means that instead of pruning down to an acceptable word count for a blog and carefully considering how much detail to include, I just try to have reasonable sized and organized notes and any reader can go into the level of detail they want.

I feel like often when I'm talking about my life, it's like showing someone a tapestry with a magnifying glass. Some parts will look different enough than others that they don't make sense without context. This at least lets you take that magnifying glass and move it around ðŸ˜†

## History

The full history of this garden can be found [on Github](https://github.com/micseydel/micseydel-mind-garden/). I may create a changelog note for here as well.

# Bonus

I'll write more about this later, but the notes for this garden live *within* my [[Obsidian]] vault.  I also have a "private" (password protected) mind garden which lives within my notes, and here is a visualization of that:
