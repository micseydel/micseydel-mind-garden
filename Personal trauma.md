I'm not sure how open I want to be here, but I have a diagnosis of CPTSD and psychiatrists have experimented with giving me medication normally meant for ADHD and schizophrenia. While I have some worry about being discriminated against, I also very much think that being "out" about things can benefit those who can't be.

# Symtoms

## Gagging

If I exercise too hard or get too emotionally stressed, I will start gagging and if I don't remove the stressor, it will become a dry heave that might get worse. I've had it happen in the middle of a talk at work, it's not fun. It also means I have a more sensitive gag reflex at the dentist.

## "Mental resets"

This is a kind of [dissociative amnesia](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/dissociative-amnesia) . I forget the conversation topic but am still aware of where I am, who I'm talking to, and stuff like that, but I typically need whoever I'm talking to to remind me of what the discussion was about.

I would guess that these happen based on triggering thoughts, but the reality is that I can't introspect on the cause due to the nature of the problem. By working on my metacognition I've improved my ability to recall the conversation topic, but this is definitely still an issue for me.
