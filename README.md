This is the initial commit for my public mind garden. My intention for this repo is to provide a publicly accessible garden and history for that garden. I will likely rebase away this commit and start relatively clean, but once I do there will not be further rebasing.

The attachments repo lives [on Github](https://github.com/micseydel/micseydel-mind-garden-attachments).
