# How is it different from a blog?

I do not currently have a blog, but if I did, posts would 
* be fairly linear ("have a point")
* have a date
* note edits with dates
* get put through [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/)
* be peer-reviewed privately before public posts

That's all a lot more work ðŸ˜† It's also all friction that would be a perfectionist distraction from my true goal, which is to get my ideas out there and start publicly living my note-making lifestyle.

That said, a blog can fulfill similar functions to this garden. Public things like this can also act like a "[[Personal knowledge management systems (PKMS)#Building a Second Brain|second brain]]" even if you're not keeping a lot of private notes.

# Advantage over a blog

The non-linear nature of this garden means that instead of pruning down to an acceptable word count for a blog and carefully considering how much detail to include, I just try to have reasonable sized and organized notes and any reader can go into the level of detail they want.

I feel like often when I'm talking about my life, it's like showing someone a [[Life Tapestry (metaphor)|tapestry]] with a magnifying glass. Some parts will look different enough from the norm that they don't make sense without context (like why a certain family member isn't in a certain part). This at least lets you take that magnifying glass and move it around ðŸ˜†
