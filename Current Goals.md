# Details

## 🐱 My Cats

One of [[My Cats]] - Peanut - needs special attention although his sister is easier. My [[#🛠 Tinkerframe]] will help but I do not neglect him for it. #takecareofmycats

Measureable outcomes -
* [FIC](https://veterinarypartner.vin.com/default.aspx?pid=19239&id=4951488) episodes seem largely preventable and when they happen, I'm prepared
* I can leave, occasionally, for an entire day feeling secure that Peanut will cope ok
* I feel confident and secure that Peanut's needs are being met

## ❤️‍🩹 Healing

I am not currently forcing myself to be productive. I am prioritizing my cats though trying to take a "put on your oxygen mask first" approach as much as I can.

Desired outcome: be able to react to triggers with skeptical curiosity instead of a fight/flight/freeze/fawn trauma response.

### 👩‍⚕️ Therapy

I am currently doing regular talk therapy with [[EMDR]] and [[Hakomi]] as adjuncts. [[Hakomi]] requires no preparation other than being present in the moment, whereas [[EMDR]] requires practice between sessions to prevent regression.

This goal relies heavily on [[My Mind Graph]] and would best be supported more by [[My Cognitive Tinkerframe]]. My mind graph has helped with the volume of critical thinking and change I'm confronted with on a weekly basis, but I'm confident I can do even better. I believe my tinkerframe will allow me to integrate more of what I learn into my life, more effectively.

### 🌱 Mind Garden

Working on my [[About this mind garden|mind garden]] (or my [[My Mind Graph]] for that matter) is a creative activity that I often find restorative. It is related to my [[#🛠 Tinkerframe]] as well but counts toward healing for now. That may change as my feelings around expression, productivity, and whatever else change. #mindgardening

### 🕸 Mind Graph

These are my private notes. Anything that *can* go in my [[#🌱 Mind Garden|mind garden]] I would prefer live in the garden over my private graph, though...

I default to writing here instead of my garden because having to consider an external audience increases cognitive load. If the notes were not 100% private -- if a partner or doctor could read them -- that would be a constant additional cognitive load as well as potential pressure to *appear* perfect, which might induce an ego reaction instead of curiosity. #mindgraphing

## 🛠 Tinkerframe

Primarily intended to help with [[#🐱 My Cats]] and [[#❤️‍🩹 Healing]] for now but the effort will be reused for future gains, especially around [[Secondary Goals#👩‍🍳 Cook more]] and [[Secondary Goals#👬 Socialize *safely*]]. #tinkering

Desired outcome: establish a pattern of approaching life problems [[My scientific method|scientifically]], meaning using hypotheses, experiments, data points and such.

Additional mind garden - a professional one where I host documentation snippets, like a personal [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.co/). I might also keep the more technical aspects of [[My Cognitive Tinkerframe]] there.
