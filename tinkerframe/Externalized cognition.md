# The Extended Mind

[[The Extended Mind (book)]] is a great place to start on extended cognition
![[The Extended Mind (book)#Parts]]

The book came out at the end of 2021 and the [[What is Building a Second Brain (BASB)|Building a Second Brain]] book came out around six months later and is essentially part 4 above - "thinking with apps" (where someone else or most likely a profit-driven business decides your system constraints).

What comes after thinking with apps? I would say (5) is "thinking with code" and (6) would be "thinking with AI" (see also: [[Artificial Intelligence (AI) and my Tinkerframe]]). What I think is magical about thinking with code though, compared to (4) and (6), is that ==the process of writing the code involves *encoding* -- unambiguously -- your intention== for that code.
