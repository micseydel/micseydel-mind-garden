# Details

## 🐱 My Cats

One of my cats - Peanut - needs special attention although his sister is easier. My [[#🛠 Tinkerframe]] will help but I do not neglect him for it. #takecareofmycats

Desired outcome: I feel confident and secure that Peanut's needs are being met. FIC episodes seem largely preventable and when they happen, I'm prepared.

## ❤️‍🩹 Healing

I am not currently forcing myself to be productive. I am prioritizing my cats though trying to take a "put on your oxygen mask first" approach as much as I can.

Desired outcome: be able to react to triggers with skeptical curiosity instead of a fight/flight/freeze/fawn trauma response.

### 👩‍⚕️ Therapy

I am currently doing regular talk therapy with adjuncts for EMDR and Hakomi. Hakomi requires no preparation other than being present in the moment, whereas EMDR requires practice between sessions to prevent regression.

For talk therapy in particular, I have a long-lived note-making system. Within the current incarnation using Obsidian, I maintain two predictably-named notes for future sessions, with aliases that include "next" and "next next" for quick searching. Before each session, I prepare a list of positives and potential topics along with any check-ins we might be doing. I also track insights and action items for afterward.

I maintain [maps of content (MOCs)](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/a-case-for-mocs/2418/15) in my [[#🕸 Mind Graph]] for each modality. The total effort of all of this is quite a bit every week. I don't intend for it to be sustainable, but the value for my healing is too great right now to "take it easy" or not worry about it.

### 🌱 Mind Garden

Working on my [[About this mind garden|mind garden]] (or my [[#🕸 Mind Graph|mind graph]] for that matter) is a creative activity that I often find restorative. It is related to my [[#🛠 Tinkerframe]] as well but counts toward healing for now. That may change as my feelings around expression, productivity, and whatever else change. #mindgardening

### 🕸 Mind Graph

These are my private notes. Anything that *can* go in my [[#🌱 Mind Garden|mind garden]] I would prefer live in the garden over my private graph, though...

I default to writing here instead of my garden because having to consider an external audience increases cognitive load. If the notes were not 100% private -- if a partner or doctor could read them -- that would be a constant additional cognitive load as well as potential pressure to *appear* perfect, which might induce an ego reaction instead of curiosity. #mindgraphing

## 🛠 Tinkerframe

Primarily intended to help with [[#🐱 My Cats]] and [[#❤️‍🩹 Healing]] for now but the effort will be reused for future gains, especially around [[#👩‍🍳 Cook more]] and [[#👬 Socialize *safely*]]. #tinkering

Desired outcome: establish a pattern of approaching life problems scientifically, meaning using hypotheses, experiments, data points and such.

See: [[My Cognitive Tinkerframe]]

## 👩‍🍳 Cook more

It might seem like this should be higher priority. I have complex trauma around food and cooking, so the [[#🛠 Tinkerframe]] may help, on top of [[#👩‍⚕️ Therapy]].

Desired outcome: cooking habit such that I feel no need to eat out.

## 🏃 Exercise more

I'd like to get in the habit of doing two runs a week, of whatever length I feel comfortable. Risk of injury discourages me somewhat.

## 👬 Socialize *safely*

I need to subject my COVID Hermiting beliefs to more skepticism, broaden the sources from which I am picking numbers. I would love to prioritize this more highly but the above goals all supersede this, especially the first three.

# Potential future plans

Next job
* AI
* Climate change
    * Materials science
* Social justice
* Large scale/durable data organizing

Additional mind garden - a professional one where I host as much of my professional-related notes as possible.
