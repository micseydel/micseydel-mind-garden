[[My Cognitive Tinkerframe]] is helping me recalibrate my [[Personal trauma#Freeze|trauma responses]]. Earlier in my life, I adapted to situations to survive and those adaptations turned out to be maladaptive in the long run.

While my tinkerframe is helping me recalibrate, *it* is also calibrated to me. I couldn't easily hand it off to someone else.
