## Personal to me ðŸ¤—

This section is for terms that I use but you won't likely see used by others. I'm currently planning on keeping it small, but these two things deserve to be differentiated.

### Mind graph ðŸ§ ðŸ•¸

This is the phrase I use to describe my private, personal notes. Because they are essentially an offline website [[Obsidian#Wiki comparison|like Wikipedia]], it's important to think of them as a *graph* (like a social network) rather than something rigid/silo'd like a filing cabinet or folder structure.

### My Cognitive Tinkerframe ðŸ§ ðŸ› ðŸ–¼

This is my primary tool for [[Cognitive Bypass]] (kind of a special term, but hopefully intuitive relative to a "coronary" bypass).

See: [[My Cognitive Tinkerframe]]

## Zettelkasten

This is something I have not looked into fully, but my understanding is that the history of this term involved [[Personal knowledge management systems (PKMS)|PKMS]] prior to computers being invented. Most people using the term today have a digital rather than analog Zettelkasten.

## Building a Second Brain (BASB)

A "second brain" is essentially a generic PKMS but usually uses PARA, avoids [[Obsidian]] and [[Networked Thinking]], and frames things in terms of CODE. It's the most common term I've seen used.
