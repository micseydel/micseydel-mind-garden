Per [webmd](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-to-know-complex-ptsd-symptoms):
> Complex PTSD is caused by prolonged or chronic trauma. Those with complex PTSD usually have at least some of the symptoms of PTSD, but they could also have other symptoms.

In terms of [treatment](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-to-know-complex-ptsd-symptoms#091e9c5e8216acb5-1-4), I am doing [[EMDR]] as an adjunct to talk therapy.
