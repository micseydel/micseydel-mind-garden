# Meaning

Hopefully it's intuitive, but I mean something comparable to a [coronary bypass](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/coronary-bypass-surgery/about/pac-20384589#:~:text=Coronary%20bypass%20surgery%20redirects%20blood,blocked%20arteries%20in%20your%20heart.). Just like an artery can be functioning poorly, a cognitive pattern could be serving us poorly. It is generally ideal to fix the underlying issue, but much like you can't fix a road while cars are driving on it, some cognitive patterns cannot be repaired if they are in active use.

I want to use [[My Cognitive Tinkerframe]] to bypass certain maladaptive cognitive patterns that are in a sense "[[Personal trauma#Freeze|load-bearing]]" in my life, so something else has to takes its place in order to fix it in a timely and proper manner.

I used this phrase because it seemed intuitive, but [[#Precedent]] below shows that (1) I'm not the first to use the term and (2) it seems to be used with a negative conotation. I may remove this term or may keep it, not sure yet.

# Accountability

With [[Externalized cognition]] cognition I find it easier to hold myself accountable. I must *bypass* whatever is going on in my ego or wrestle with that part of me in order for accountability to happen.
