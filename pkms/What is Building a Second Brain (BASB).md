# Jargon?

Neither of those resources mention [[Jargon#Building a Second Brain (BASB)|jargon]] like CODE or PARA. (Citation needed but) I'm pretty sure Tiago uses the term both in a generic fashion but also as a [brand](https://help.fortelabs.com/article/203-how-can-i-use-the-basb-brand), which makes me more hesistant to identify with it.
