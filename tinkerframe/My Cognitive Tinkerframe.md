# Introduction

## The problem

Around the time I got my [[CPTSD]] diagnosis, I started realizing I couldn't necessarily do everything I thought I could. In particular, acting as a caregiver to [[My Cats|my cats]] induced severe [[Personal trauma#Freeze|trauma responses]] üòø Compounding this problem was (is) very scarce support from other people along with distrust of new people due to my trauma üôÉ

## The solution

A [[Cognitive Bypass]] system that is as separate from other minds as possible. Leveraging scientific ideas like focusing on testable hypotheses, I started tinkering with how I interacted with my cats. For example, here are testable hypotheses when my cat is meowing:
* He wants fresh kibble
* He wants fresh water
* He wants the litter cleaned
* He wants me to get out of bed (it's a thing)
* He wants me to get *into* bed (he likes getting pets there)
* He wants playtime

Usually he's satisfied after I test each of these hypotheses, but my trauma brain's response to "What can I do to make him happy?" is unfortunately, "[[Personal trauma#Freeze|FREEZE]]!" The initial tinkerframe was essentially just the hypotheses above on a whiteboard, I bypassed my regular cognition by *[[Externalized cognition|externalizing my mind]]*.

## The solution - extended

Analog tools like a [conspiracy board](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pepe-silvia) or [[Personal knowledge management systems (PKMS)#Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]] could solve a lot of problems, but the biggest advantage of a digital system is that you can ==encode== *programs* and not just *data*. The definition...

...does not require any digital tools, but the whiteboard example above could obviously very easily be turned into an app, or web flowchart rather than a simple list.
