I'm a self-taught coder who got a bachelor's and [became an "engineer"](https://www.linkedin.com/in/micseydel/) in silicon valley. I use they/them pronouns and identify as
* Gray asexual 💜🖤🤍
* Polyamorous 💙❤️🖤
* (and)
* Nonbinary 💛🤍💜🖤

I've worked hard at times, but privilege and [[Luck]] have been big parts of my journey as well. My philosophy, in theory, is to be *skeptically curious*. Curiosity is center, but I prefer to be skeptical as a modifier. You might want to checkout [[What I've been up to]] or [[My Cognitive Tinkerframe]].
