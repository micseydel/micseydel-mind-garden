# Modern - 2018 onward

As of 2018(ish) I was using primarily Google Docs but also Trello and Google Keep. I had a very slow start, primarily working out of a "Scratchpad" doc and I didn't consider creating a second doc until the first was 20+ pages. I had also been centering things around Google Inbox due to its snoozing features, and it was a painful lurch in 2019 when Google had said they were porting all the features but then it turned out location-based snoozing wasn't included ðŸ˜¬

(note for later I should mention my *work* notes from that time although I no longer have access)
* Daily notes
* Scratchpad
* What else??

In summer 2020 I was doing therapy and would collect notes in my Scratchpad. I started splitting out different session notes into separate docs, then started creating them proactively and then created a template that changed over time. My system grew organically based on needs.

In early 2021 I started a daily bullet journal when things with my roommates got weird. I was using my Scratchpad pretty much daily by that point but I think this made the habit more firm. My therapy notes were getting more filled out and I also started creating separate docs more frequently. Places I wanted to hike. *Lots* of comparison tables, when considering a phone, different apartments to move into, whatever.

In early 2022, I started feeling very held back by Google Docs. Trello and Google Keep were not solutions. I tried Notion, Airtable, I looked super briefly at Evernote. Nothing felt right. I decided I wanted to build a personal, lifelong wiki and a system that would use more tags and less folders.

In February in particular, I felt *extremely* held back by my system. I had grown it organically, and did not even consider the idea that I could learn from organization from others ðŸ˜† I was totally ignorant of PKM as a practice or community and in March tried to install wiki software on my Raspberry Pi (a $35 computer I could run a little server on). I was struggling with mental health at the time and sadly gave up. March wasn't fun either.

In April, _Too Many Thoughts Living Rent-Free In Your Head? Try Mind Gardening_Â ([refinery29](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/04/10953988/mind-gardening-organize-thoughts-increase-productivity)) entered my Google Now feed. I read it on the 27th and signed up for Roam Research on the 29th. Wikipedia was founded in 2001 and there is no single source of information so well-organized and explorable without any prior context, so while I was skeptical of Roam (I avoided anything but basic features initially) I was confident in a wiki-based system of some kind. Software engineers talk about reading code they wrote 6 months ago and thinking it was written by someone else, and that's how I imagine using tools that rely on folders and even tags - links to first-class, fairly small notes are the way to go.

## Roam Research

(to add - notes on how I nearly gave up because I used to use tables so heavily)

I think I originally looked at Roam Research, [[Obsidian]] and Logseq to experiment with migrating from Google Docs. I was going to build a mind garden but decided to do something more private first. I chose Roam Research initially but made a conscious effort to *not* learn keyboard shortcuts or any features specific to Roam, because I didn't want to have to do more than one serious migration in the short term. I didn't want to fall prey to "shiny new tool syndrome" (a term I'd learn later) after having so carefully stayed on Google Docs.

Roam ended up being incredibly addictive. It was a wiki like I wanted, and it had bullet points like my bullet journal, but unlike Google Docs I could very easily *collapse bullets* (this is seriously so important to me) as well as *link to blocks* and easily break notes into smaller ones.

I ended up creating a "mind graph" note which was a kind of center hub which linked out to Google Drive folders and docs as well as Trello boards, my early Notion experiments, links to mirrors of my old blog that went down, as well as some other stuff like Google Recorder. I thought of this as my "digital atlas" - a collection of different books. Quickly though, Trello and Notion seemed like distractions and what I cared about in Google Drive got migrated over. That note still exists but it's archival at this point, meaning not linked to any active notes.

I accidentally stumbled across block embeds and block references. I could not help but use them, though I was afraid of lock-in. I tested out [this migration script](https://github.com/renerocksai/rj2obs) and found that it had issues but would serve as an "emergency eject" if Roam became unreliable. Roam did hourly backups, which is also a little anxiety-inducing for me. I know that insights can be contextual, so it's not simply a matter of re-doing an hour of work if something went wrong.

In May I would read *What is Networked Thinking and How It Can Benefit You* ([appsntips](https://www.appsntips.com/what-is-networked-thinking/)) which would give me the ==concept handle== "networked thinking" to describe things. At this point I may have seen Building a Second Brain (BASB) and Linking Your Thinking  (LYT) materials as well as references to Zettelkasten, and I wasn't interested in any of it. Being a self-taught coder, I felt like I could figure things out myself, at least insofar as identifying major blockers or points of friction in my system worthy of asking questions. I did my own thing until...

## Building a Second Brain - Tiago Forte

I haven't found the link yet, but I came across something somewhere that referred to their PKMS as a "collaborator" (probably a Zettelkasten, looking back). I feel pretty connected with my notes, but this seemed a bit much. Later it occurred to me - I could perhaps understand that perspective if psychedelics were involved.

I Google'd **"second brain" psychedelics** even though I'd been referring to my "mind graph" and had not used the BASB terminology at all, because "second brain" seemed to be the primary term people used to refer to their notes. That lead me toÂ _Tiago Forte on Intuition, Breathwork & What it Feels like to Have a Second Brain_Â ([Curious Humans on Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy50cmFuc2lzdG9yLmZtL2N1cmlvdXMtaHVtYW5z/episode/OTU3ODRjNTUtZDFhOC00NGIyLWE4MjMtMDZlY2M1ZTE4ZWI3?sa=X&ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwjoy-agxrf4AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQLA)).  He talked about having a throat issue and being prescribed a serious anti-seizure medication and boy does that sound personally familiar! See: [[Personal Trauma#Gagging]]

He had just released his book that week, so I ordered it and signed up for the book club. I updated my LinkedIn to say I'm building a second brain and took on the terminology.

## Obsidian

Though Roam Research is amazing in a lot of ways, I am currently using (and very happy with) [[Obsidian]]. I wrote a script that I plan to publish which builds on one I found someone else had written. My code (1) tried to use fewer side-effects and be more like a pipeline and (2) does references in Obsidian's newer formatting.

# After move to Obsidian

I joined the [[Personal knowledge management systems (PKMS)#Building a Second Brain|BASB]] course cohort 15. I haven't been able to get it the attention it might deserve but we'll see how cohort 16 goes.

# Historical - prior to 2018

## High school

I would say that my code portfolio when I was a young coder was a kind of PKM, though not in any deliberate way. The magic of it though was that if I had to do something new, I could draw on prior code that might save 80% of the effort. Others' code would be helpful too, but I had *rapport* with my own system so it was substantially faster in spite of not having any deliberate organization beyond the scale of a project.

## College through 2018

At some point in college I lost my code from high school ðŸ˜­ I had been learning coding very fast, and losing the PKMS I had, immature as it was, was a major blow. It didn't feel like it because I had to work on school projects where things were more new rather than building on old stuff, but it honestly limited my personal projects more than the time distraction of my coursework. Had I realized what I lost, I might have started over properly but I did not.

I think that if I had maintained that momentum, I would be a much better tinker today. I do wonder if that's what makes a 10x engineer - not someone who works so much harder, but someone who takes writing things down seriously and re-using your efforts.

# To add

* I was anti folder and pro tag, but have actually used links instead of tags.
* Work
	* Hourly bullets
	* Getting pinged too much
* Palm device, dad as a rolemodel
* Links to Slack messages in my work notes
* I no longer have a ton of tabs open, I create a note with links and instead of feeling like I have to *use* all those tabs before I close them, they're exactly where and when I need them
