# Solved problems

- Keeping track of experiments - hypotheses, observations, etc
- Tracking expiration of items (food, medicine, etc)
- Preventing taking too much medication
    - Like me with acetaminophen
- Voice memos for anything related to my cats
- Location-based snoozing

# Aspirational

- Notify me when beliefs I hold appear to be inconsistent
- Notify me when a changed belief means a domino effect that I should look into

# To organize

- *Reframing*
- Skill graph (not a tree)
- Performs encoding for me

## Misc tooling

- Screenshots automatically go to vault instead of desktop (on OS X at least)
- Automatically put Fitbit data into daily notes, or something that the daily notes template links to
- Browser history integrated into my notes
- Fully tracking of my system
    - Tracking for each note, when it was last modified, opened, linked to, etc
    - Why? Because when people talk about it being ok to lose notes, because you don't look at most of the old notes, I can investigate very specific questions about that
        - How many notes are never touched after they're created?
        - Heat map of my graph, hubs, over time (with git or excessive yaml pushed out to separate files)
