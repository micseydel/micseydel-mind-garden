# Parts 

1. Thinking with Our Bodies
2. Thinking with Our Surroundings
3. Thinking with Our Relationships

# Summary

I may write more of a summary at some point.

I will say for now that [[#Parts|part]] 1 talks about interoception and essentially *listening to your gut*. This kind of makes our *body* or our guts our "second" brain with subsequent additions.
