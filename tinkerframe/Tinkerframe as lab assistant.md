# Intro

* ...who can do things a human cannot do
	* Be in my pocket 24/7 ðŸ˜†
	* Knows [[My Mind Graph]] inside and out
	* Waaay faster
* ...can't do certain things humans can
	* Give my cats medicine
* My tinkerframe can learn from me, but not on its own - AI would be needed for that
	* Maybe that's what's different from a SB?

I visualize my tinkerframe as a big frame I am within, and it has hands that are holding instruments like a beaker, and flask, and temperature gauage, a camera, etc.

## Change in frame of mind

Instead of doing things myself, I want to "teach my assistant" and then manage that assistant.

# From a BASB lens

Using [[Jargon#CODE (knowledge pipeline)]]

* Capture - becomes more automated
	* Google Timeline
	* Air quality
	* Temperature
* Organize - populate a Git submodule
* Distill - only bother organizing things that are flagged for me
* Express - things I couldn't have before

# Tony Stark comparison

I couldn't resist this, but [[My Mind Graph]] is kind of like the arc reactor and [[My Cognitive Tinkerframe]] is kind of like Jarvis. Please don't compare me to Elon Musk ðŸ˜† I created my mind graph for acute survival, and am now using it to "power" my tinkerframe in order to escape my current situation.
