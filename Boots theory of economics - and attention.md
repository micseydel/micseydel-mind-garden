# Boots theory

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_theory) quoting Discworld:
> The reason that ==the rich== were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they ==managed to spend less money==. Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. ==A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet==. This was the Captain Samuel Vimes "Boots" theory of ==socioeconomic unfairness==.

The tl;dr above is that sometimes it's **hard to save money without initial capital to invest**. For the moment, I am not going to get into the economics here, rather I want to look at the underlying pattern...

# Attention economics

I think there is an important analog, of people's attention. [[Personal knowledge management systems (PKMS)]] are a way for people to free up their attention and have more of it for what they care about. So why doesn't *everyone* do it? There are obvious reasons of not knowing better or not believing in the benefit. But what about those who know and believe, but don't?

Many **people perceive themselves as having "no time"** and attention is bounded by time (people do not generally have *more* attention than time). While sometimes this is simply a matter of poor time management, I think there is a very real phenomena today where people (especially parents and those who have to hustle to survive) have a true scarcity of attention that can result in a kind of debt-trap cycle like the situation cited above. Many **people are "paycheck to paycheck" on attention** and lack a surplus to escape the debt cycle.

I don't have a solution even though this is clearly unfair. I think that [direct cash gifts can help people escape poverty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAoIuWCzkac&t=382s)  and that a similar gift of attention could help if the opportunity is leveraged, but I can't personally say I know how to bootstrap parents into a note-making habit ðŸ¤·
