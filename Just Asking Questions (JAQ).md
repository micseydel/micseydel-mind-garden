# Broad interpretation

I'm guilty of saying "I wonder..." at times when I wasn't actually motivated to learn. I was *just* asking... not seeking. I think it becomes JAQing off when done in public, including on social media, particularly for shock value or if you want to seem smart (e.g. because it's baked into your identity ðŸ˜±).

I don't want [[About this mind garden|this mind garden]] to just have questions, like some [reactive, mindless Twitter feed](twitter.com/elonmusk/) might. I don't want the ideas within it to be one-offs - instead [[Networked Thinking|they are connected]]. If I'm having a discussion with someone, I'd like to be able to connect it to this larger collection of thoughts and demostrate credibility by showing that I am not just a question-asker, but also a seeker, [[My Cognitive Tinkerframe|tinker]] and creator.
