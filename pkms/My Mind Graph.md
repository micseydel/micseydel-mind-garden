![[Jargon#Mind graph ðŸ§ ðŸ•¸]]

The equivalent term others use might be "[[Jargon#Building a Second Brain (BASB)|second brain]]" or [[Jargon#Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]]. This is where anything I learn via [[My Cognitive Tinkerframe]] lives. It is highly personalized to me.

# Implementation

You might just want to hear that I use [[Obsidian]]. In my mind, my mind graph isn't tied to a tool like Obsidian, but rather it is the (admittedly Obsidian-biased) Markdown that I store in Git. I named the folder "deliberate_knowledge_accretion" and use DKA as an alias for the vault/repo at times.

## Details

This garden is actually a Git submodule within my mind graph. Here is a visualization from 2022-11-04 (prior to this version of the garden) where the green is my garden, the red is a private password-protected garden, and the blue are my private notes:
