# Today

Primarily [[My Mind Graph]] and my whiteboard. Working on [[My scientific method]].

# Tomorrow

Chatbot as described in [[Thinking with Code]]. Extending on that to use [[Transcribed Voice Memos]] and perhaps Alexa. Primary focuses will be on headaches, cats, and the rest of my [[Current Goals]].

# The Future

Wishlist
* Audit *existing* beliefs (inconsistencies)
* Event management
	* Voice memos
	* Cats - food, litter use, behavior
* Task management, e.g. queue for Google Photos
* Ideas as objects (need to read [this](https://stephanango.com/evergreen-notes))
* [[Artificial Intelligence (AI) and my Tinkerframe]]
