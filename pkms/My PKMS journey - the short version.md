Background: [[Personal knowledge management systems (PKMS)]]

# Historical

In high school, the code that I had written acted as a kind of narrow PKM. When I eventually lost that code by accident, it hurt, and it would have hurt more had I realized what I was giving up by not being able to build on that code.

When I started working as a software engineer, the documentation and code at the company ended up being a kind of KMS that felt personal. Each time I left those companies, I left behind a lot of knowledge that I cannot get back easily. Besides the shared resources, I also kept personal notes at work for which I had no private equivalent, and I obviously lost those since they were owned by the company as well.

In 2020 I started taking notes more seriously. I had grown the habit at work but decided to put it toward my recently-started talk therapy. Each session was a note and I developed a template with before/during/after sessions, along with insights/action items in the after section. In 2021 I started a daily bullet journal and that allowed me to organically take more notes. Eventually I decided Google Docs was not the right tool and that I wanted a personal wiki instead.

# Today

After having learned about [[Networked Thinking]] and making a detour through Roam Research I decided to use [[Obsidian]]. I haven't messed with themes or [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) yet and I don't use a lot of community plugins. Here's what I have at the time of this writing:

* Periodic Notes
* Outliner
* Omnisearch
* Clear Unused Images
* (disabled)
	* Drag-n-Drop for blocks
	* Zoom

I don't consider Obsidian to be as core to my system as someone using Evernote might feel about that tool. The reason for this is that if somehow Obsidian becomes totally, 100% unuseable (less likely than Evernote but hey), the files are local, plaintext and are kept locally on multiple devices I own.

I can SSH into the Raspberry Pi where I host my private Git repo, and between **grep** and **less** I can read anything I might want to. I could use nano, ed or vim to edit things. Obsidian is a powerful tool that allows me to accomplish my goals faster than simpler tools, but it's not essential. As Logseq matures, I will consider using it as well, but I will feel secure knowing that I'm using Git and that my notes are safe.
