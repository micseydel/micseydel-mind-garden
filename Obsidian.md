# What is Obsidian?

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a [[Personal knowledge management systems (PKMS)]] tool. It is often used for [[Networked Thinking]], as opposed to Evernote or Apple Notes. It is not a SaaS (software as a service) as is so common today, instead the files are local to your device. Those files are *plaintext* meaning that I don't need special software to review and understand them.

# Why do I use Obsidian?

* It's plaintext
	* Future-proof
	* As a coder, this means I am totally unlimited in changing that text
* It's local-first
	* I don't have worry about a [changed privacy policy](https://thenextweb.com/news/evernote-employees-can-now-read-your-notes-heres-how-to-stop-them)
	* I'm able to take responsibility for security rather than trusting a profit-driven corporation
* It suits my needs
	* I can use Git with it
	* No other tool has looked as appealing (Roam Research was close)
	* I wanted to build a personal wiki

The biggest drawback for me is how shiny and new it is. That said, for now I have avoided looking at themes or many extensions, which I mention because many complain that they cannot help themselves but to customize it.

# Wiki comparison

[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki),
> A wiki is an online ==hypertext publication== collaboratively edited and managed by its own audience, using a web browser. A typical wiki ==contains multiple pages for the subjects or scope of the project, and could be either open to the public or limited== to use within an organization for maintaining its internal knowledge base. 

In its simplest form, Obsidian is great for creating a private, personal wiki. The [[About this mind garden|mind garden]] you are viewing right now uses [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish). While it may not be as editable as Wikipedia, especially via Obsidian Publish, the entire thing is [on Github](https://github.com/micseydel/micseydel-mind-garden/) so it *can* be collaborated on.

If I wasn't using Obsidian, I would most likely still be striving for something wiki-like.

# Should you use Obsidian?

Picking a [[Personal knowledge management systems (PKMS)|PKMS]] or "[[My PKMS journey - the short version#Building a Second Brain - Tiago Forte|second brain]]" tool or set of tools is highly personal. I would personally recommend and love if everyone tried Obsidian, but if it doesn't immediately resonate with you I would recommend trying at least one other tool as well.

If you already have a PKMS going, I would ask yourself what your goals are. Is anything coming up where you want to make sure your system is stable? Do you have problems with your current system? Are they written down? I hate to say it, but if the answer to that last question is *no* then it's probably not the tool holding you back!

# Alternatives

* Roam (tried)
* Logseq
* Tiddlywiki
* Vimwiki (will investigate for an "emergency eject")

# Comparison to Minecraft

I've never really played Minecraft but *Why is Obsidian like Minecraft?* ([r/ObsidianMD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/uzs4xk/why_is_obsidian_like_minecraft/)) was a fun read. If you're someone who's played Minecraft it would probably speak to you, but I think I got the spirit of it.
