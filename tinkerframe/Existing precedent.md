I think it's fair to say that social media such as Facebook can act as a cognitive tinkerframe. The biggest differences are (1) what is being optimized for and (2) who is aware of what. The Algorithm isn't necessarily operating on people with regard to things they can be conscious of, it may go straight to our ego and bypass being easy to understand.
