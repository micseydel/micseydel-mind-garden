## A Tinkerframe isn't limited to code

There's nothing about a "cognitive tinkerframe" that requires digital tooling be involved. Anything I do that helps me to use the scientific method to bypass cognitive limits is part of my cognitive tinkerframe. (See also: [[#Precedent]])

This could mean sticky notes, or in my case, a whiteboard. When my cat is yowling and I can't figure out why, I can go to my whiteboard and write up (and read previously-written) hypotheses about why. I can link the hypotheses to experiments I can run, such as starting playtime.

While I'd like to manage such hypotheses in a purely digital manner, I have not had the cognitive bandwidth to write all the code I'd like. There is a part of me which is still recovering from perfectionism that tempts me to not "waste time" using the whiteboard, but in practice it's better to let the whiteboard help with my problem *now* and loop back around to automation.

While that doesn't directly help me with physically giving my kitty medicine, it does mean that we will both be calmer when that time comes. It means that we'll both arrive at that stressful situation having more confidence that the issue will be resolved.
