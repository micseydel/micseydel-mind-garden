[This random website](https://www.appsntips.com/what-is-networked-thinking/) is where I learned the term. I should probably re-read it, but after learning about [mind gardening](https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/mind-gardening-organise-thoughts-increase-productivity) I stumbled across this term. The tl;dr is that I'd rather do my [[Personal knowledge management systems (PKMS)|PKM]] in a wiki than a filing cabinet.

# Folders

I am not a fan of folders. I don't use them in [[My Mind Graph]] very much, and I spent zero time most days thinking about folders - the folders I do have (periodic notes, non-text attachments) are managed via configuration. I recently reviewed some of my old Google Drive noets and I did *not* miss using folders.

That said, now that I have avoided them a lot for several months, I am experimenting with using them in a private instance as well as for [[My Cognitive Tinkerframe]] in this vault.

# Processing Trauma

I was originally using Google Docs, but switched to Roam Reseach and eventually [[Obsidian]]. Nothing as complicated as my tinkerframe idea is needed, I would just recommend either daily journaling in Roam or installing the daily or periodic notes plugin for Obsidian. All you need to do to get started is write daily notes, you don't even have to understand Markdown.

I found networked thinking to be preferable to what I was doing before due to the non-linear nature of processing trauma. I tried very hard to linearize everything, but it was impossible.
