[This random website](https://www.appsntips.com/what-is-networked-thinking/) is where I learned the term. I should probably re-read it, but after learning about [mind gardening](https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/mind-gardening-organise-thoughts-increase-productivity) I stumbled across this term. The tl;dr is that I'd rather do my [[Personal knowledge management systems (PKMS)|PKM]] in a wiki than a filing cabinet.
