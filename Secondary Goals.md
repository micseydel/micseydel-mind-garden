# Secondary goals

## 👩‍🍳 Cook more

It might seem like this should be higher priority. I have complex trauma around food and cooking, so the [[#🛠 Tinkerframe]] may help, on top of [[#👩‍⚕️ Therapy]].

Desired outcome: cooking habit such that I feel no need to eat out.
In conflict with: [[Current Goals#🐱 My Cats]] because Peanut seems to get upset when I cook 🤔🤷 He's definitely sensitive to sound, so this is something to explore when his current (at the time of this writing) FIC episode passes.

## 🏃 Exercise more

I'd like to get in the habit of doing two runs a week, of whatever length I feel comfortable, probably around 4 miles. I've do bareful and minimalist running since 2010 and plan to wear [Skinners](https://skinners.cc/en/skinners-comfort).

I'd also like to hike more. [[#👩‍🍳 Cook more]] would help with this since I have IBS, but primarily [[Current Goals#🐱 My Cats]] is the biggest blocker, that I'm reluctant to be out too long and if I get injured/delayed it can affect them negatively.

## 👬 Socialize *safely*

I need to subject my COVID Hermiting beliefs to more skepticism as well as broaden the sources from which I am picking numbers regarding long COVID. I would love to prioritize this more highly but the above goals all supersede this.

tl;dr - brain fog, fatigue and loss of smell would all negatively affected [[Current Goals#🐱 My Cats]]. I'm even delaying my latest booster until I'm more confident that I can be knocked down for a week with side effects again.
