# The Problem

Human beings have cognitive limits. This includes [biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) and scarcities of time and attention, as well as things like trauma. I would say that my personal trauma has resulted in a need to recalibrate myself.

For example, back in June I had a severe trauma response when told I needed to give my cat medicine, but more recently I was given a similar assignment after doing some reprocessing in [[Current Goals#‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Healing|EMDR]], and even though the second assignment was more work, I didn't have such a negative response. Trauma aside, I have wondered what NSAID (or related) might work best for me. What is stopping me from finding this out? Primarily a scarcity of attention.

# Externalized cognition

Prior solutions to this problem typically involve an additional human being. Science, for example, uses peer-review, and therapy is another (more intimate) context in which to get peer-review. Peer-review is great, but what do scientists do before submitting their work for peer-review? They check the math!

I don't have "math" in the sense of a formula like `F = M x A` for my problems, but there are ways I can use my [[Personal knowledge management systems (PKMS)|PKMS]] to perform a *cognitive bypass* (like a [heart bypass surgery](https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-bypass-surgery)). Let's take the headache intervention example mentioned above.

## Example - headache interventions

Leaving the trauma-based example aside, how can I figure out what helps with my headaches? I mentioned *attention* is the limiting factor, so a better tool might help given that I'm not fundamentally stopped from doing that work manually.

Imagine that instead of doing the work yourself, you could text a friend. You would just say "headache" and they'd reply back with a suggested intervention. That intervention might be naproxen, ibuprofen, aspirin or even to wait or meditate, and your friend could text you again after a random waiting period to "sample" how things are going. Your friend could use your replies to build statistics that model which is most likely to help you personally. This is a cognitive bypass.

## Replacing thinking with code

I don't have any friends I want to offload statistics to, unfortunately. But in high school I wrote code that used SMS/MMS as the interface, and gathering data is pretty straighforward to code up, so I don't need a friend üéâ

I suspect that headaches are a pretty relatable example example here. But what about trauma responses? How can I "bypass" having a CPTSD freeze response when needing to give my cat medicine? Above, I am bypassing the required attention of making and organizing notes, but I can't replace physical machinations with code.

## ...but not just code

There's nothing about a "cognitive tinkerframe" that requires digital tooling be involved. Anything I do that helps me to use the scientific method to bypass cognitive limits is part of my cognitive tinkerframe. (See also: [[#Precedent]])

This could mean sticky notes, or in my case, a whiteboard. When my cat is yowling and I can't figure out why, I can go to my whiteboard and write up (and read previously-written) hypotheses about why. I can link the hypotheses to experiments I can run, such as starting playtime.

While I'd like to manage such hypotheses in a purely digital manner, I have not had the cognitive bandwidth to write all the code I'd like. There is a part of me which is still recovering from perfectionism that tempts me to not "waste time" using the whiteboard, but in practice it's better to let the whiteboard help with my problem *now* and loop back around to automation.

While that doesn't directly help me with physically giving my kitty medicine, it does mean that we will both be calmer when that time comes. It means that we'll both arrive at that stressful situation having more confidence that the issue will be resolved.

## Artificial Intelligence

I am confident [human-AI fusion is the way of the future](https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/commentanalysis/arid-30975938.html). That said, for now I am focusing on non-AI solutions, other than for things like voice memo transcription or image classification.

# Science!

Framing things in term of hypotheses, observations, and experiments has helped me without involving any code. For example, when my cat meows, hypotheses might include

* He wants fresh kibble
* He wants fresh water
* He wants the litter sifted
* He wants me to get out of bed
* He wants me to get *into* bed (it's a good place for pets)
* He wants playtime

Those are all quite easily tested, but if they're not written down and I try all but one, he might keep whining. [[Personal knowledge management systems (PKMS)|PKMS]] helps a lot with this.

# Precedent

I think it's fair to say that social media such as Facebook can act as a cognitive tinkerframe. The biggest differences are (1) what is being optimized for and (2) who is aware of what. The Algorithm isn't necessarily operating on people with regard to things they can be conscious of, it may go straight to our ego and bypass being easy to understand.
