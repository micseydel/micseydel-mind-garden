If our lives are a tapestry
* Most weave them by hand, without paying attention
* BASB is like using a loom, maybe power loom
* Tinkerframe is like a *programmable* power loom
	* I want to use this garden as a way to showcase *integrating* into my life tapestry things I learn in [[Current Goals#👩‍⚕️ Therapy]].

[[Integration]] is like weaving.

I need to elaborate on why this connects to my thoughts on spirituality.
