# Comparision to science

In contemporary science, pre-registration ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preregistration_(science)), [Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg)) is an essential tool for limiting bias, be it intentional or not. Wikipedia says it's...

> the practice of registering the hypotheses, methods, and/or analyses of a scientific study before it is conducted

The COS says

> Preregistration separatesÂ _hypothesis-generating_Â  (exploratory)Â fromÂ _hypothesis-testing_Â (confirmatory)Â research.

This helps humans, who naturally have flaws and biases, to stay honest. It's easy to make excuses after the fact for why you changed things, if those excuses can be hidden and never revealed. We all do it, but I'm trying to include in [[My Cognitive Tinkerframe]] the habit of "pre-registering" (encoding) my intentions in [[My Mind Graph]].

# Personal Intentionality

After my intentions are written as text in my notes, I use Git to literally "commit" those notes to my mind graph. I can delete the note, but I can't easily modify the history and generally make a habit not to modify the history. This helps me stay honest with myself.

I have struggled with depression and learned helplessness so it's easy to fall into a pattern of giving up. It's easy to just forget that I cared and to seek distraction from my disappointment. Instead, I can write down an intention, for example, debugging a particular electronic device I'm having issues with, and each time I think I should give up I can write down why. Usually this gets me pretty far along to a solution, I can easily take a break and return to it since it's all in my notes, and if I ultimately cannot figure it out then I have a rich record of my attempts for when I seek help.

# Encoding in public

Encoding in public has two primary benefits:
1. peer-review
2. empowering others to hold you accountable

A trivial example might be new years' resolutions. Putting them out publicly means that others might helpfully point out that too much change too fast isn't sustainable. Others might followup with you during your journey.

"Encoding" could be done as a single simple post to social media. I'm trying to build an [[Integration|integrated]] [[Life Tapestry (metaphor)|life tapestry]] though, not just make a Tweet that will be forgotten. I want to weave my intentions into my larger [[My Mind Graph|mind graph]] in order to prevent things falling by the wayside, as well as to achieve synergies between goals.

# Magic

When it comes to computer programming, I can encode my intentions such that they can be carried out for me, without involving any other agents/minds. This feels like *magic* to me - my will can be carried out on a continuous basis with finite (rather than continuous) energy investment from me. Where does the energy come from? Electricity!

[[My Cognitive Tinkerframe]] includes encoding intentions unambiguously, using a computer programming language, such that a computer could carry out the intention for me. As a simple example, probably one of the biggest bits of code I've written since leaving my last job was to automate turning my air purifier on and off based on my indoor air quality sensor's reading.

## Programming and relativism

Programming something requires a certain degree of being unambiguous (ignoring undefined behavior). I do want to point out that that "unambiguous" code is coupled to its compiler/interpreter, and that even if it is objective in a sense, if the instructions are meant for a human instead of a computer then the code is arguably *ambiguous* through that lens.

Similarly, having someone else's encoding of your intention might be ok, but when you've performed the encoding *yourself* there are advantanges:
1. One less mind involved where miscommunication could occur
2. You may find during the encoding process potential inconsistencies
3. If your intention changes, you're familiar enough with the encoding to change it yourself
