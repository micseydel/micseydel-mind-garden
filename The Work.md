This is a phrase that often gets tossed around in mental health spaces, especially informal ones like on social media. [Here is a reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/v4ztge/you_gotta_do_the_work_whatever_that_is/ib7rkhr/?context=3) (with highlights added) I wrote on 2022-06-04, in response to someone asking what the work *is*:

> I had this question recently. ==For me, a big part of "the work" is research and note-taking to organize my thoughts==. I Google'd "what does it mean to do the work" and found these two links worth looking at:
> 
> [https://ellenvora.com/what-it-means-to-do-the-work/](https://ellenvora.com/what-it-means-to-do-the-work/) - could be summarized as, ==let yourself become uncomfortable==, "Get curious about it, explore it, listen"
> 
> [http://www.melgreene.com/reflections-learnings/doing-the-work](http://www.melgreene.com/reflections-learnings/doing-the-work) - "==different for everyone, but a commonality will be effort==" and while that might sound obvious, some people develop habits around avoiding effort subconsciously. It mentions curiosity as well.
> 
> I'd recommend reading both in full, but I like reading ðŸ™‚ Really though, part of the work is ==personal connection== so you have to read whole resources to find the parts that resonate with you and your situation right now. The other Google results didn't resonate with me but they might with you.
> 
> It's also about the _right_ effort. I used to take notes in Google Docs but switched to Roam Research and now Obsidian, because Google Docs started to hold me back. I referenced my notes for this post, and also added quotes from this great thread to those notes. While looking at them today, I came up with another idea that I didn't see anywhere else...
> 
> Some work is continuous and some is completable. Note-taking for me is continuous - I plan to do so for the rest of my life, to one degree or another; I'll write about unpleasant experiences and link them, etc. But switching tools is _completable_, and in fact, ==if I am _constantly_ "working" on switching tools then I'm probably distracting myself from doing the (real) work==.
