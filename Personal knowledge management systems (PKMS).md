# General

Personal knowledge management (PKM) is the practice of taking notes that are useful in a lifelong fashion. [[#Building a Second Brain]] is probably the largest community doing it right now so if you see "BASB" or "second brain" that's PKM. There's also [[#Linking Your Thinking]] (LYT or "light") though I haven't looked into it much yet. When **S** is at the end, it's about the *system* rather than the *practice*.

I think the "personal" part of PKM is particularly important. As a software engineer, I've done substantial KM using wiki software like Confluence, but "personal" KM means that you can develop intimate ==rapport== with your system instead of worrying about how others might engage with what you write. If you took two brilliant people and gave them the same information to organize into a PKMS, there would clearly be overlap but the systems would be wildly different and not interchangeable.

## Building a Second Brain

[Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) is the system invented by Tiago Forte. It is available as a book as well as a course. You can think of BASB as PKMS with *productivity* being an important part of the community. If you see talk about CODE (capture, organize, distill, express) or PARA (projects, areas, resources and archive) those are BASB terms.

## Linking Your Thinking

[Linking Your Thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/) is the biggest competitor to BASB. I honestly have not looked at it much, I have focused on BASB since I often agree easily with LYT.

## Zettelkasten

This is a term you might see used, but I have to dig in and learn more. I know that prior to computers being invented, someone was using *paper* for this, although modern practitioners are likely to involve digital tools.
