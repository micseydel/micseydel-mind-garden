This is Tiago Forte's PKMS using PARA and CODE. It is focused around *productivity* rather than creativity, as opposed to [[public_mind_garden/Linking Your Thinking]].

# Tiago Forte

He started his note-taking practice to solve a throat issue. I need to find a good link for his "origin story".

I think that he has some valuable things to share, but I also get [an Elon Musk/Donald Trump vibe](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1397695953130295298) from him sometimes and other times [I just am surprised](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1546000076866215936). In spite of his note-taking practice he also clearly [doesn't plan his tweets carefully](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1546596283741241344) and is probably just [[0_mind_garden/private_mind_garden/Elon Musk|going with his gut]].

I'd like to find him addressing a steelman of [[0_mind_garden/private_mind_garden/buffer/pkm/Networked Thinking]] since I've only seen him be dismissive and reductive on the topic.

## Origin story

Tiago started his note-taking practice to solve a throat issue. Hey, I have a [[Personal Trauma#Trauma Symptoms|throat issue]]!

# Course

I would recommend starting with the book and spending months with it before considering Tiago's course. I also need to look into the [[public_mind_garden/Linking Your Thinking|LYT]] starter kit, which I suspect would provide more value (and is free).
